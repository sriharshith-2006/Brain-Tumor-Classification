## 📌 Overview

**Brain Tumor Classification** is an end-to-end Deep Learning project that automatically classifies Brain MRI scans into one of **four categories** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The application ships with an interactive **Streamlit** interface — upload an MRI image and instantly get back the predicted tumor class along with the model's confidence score.

This project demonstrates a complete Deep Learning workflow:

> `Data Preprocessing` → `CNN Development` → `Training` → `Evaluation` → `Prediction` → `Web App` → `Cloud Deployment`

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a **Brain MRI image dataset** spanning four classes:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- No Tumor
- Pituitary

**Image Size:** All MRI scans are resized to `224 × 224` before being passed to the CNN model.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The trained model was evaluated on a held-out **test dataset**, measuring:

- ✅ Classification Accuracy
- ✅ Prediction Confidence
- ✅ Confusion Matrix

**Example prediction output:**

```
Prediction : Glioma
Confidence : 98.74%
```

### 🔍 Predictions on Random Test Samples

Below are predictions made by the trained model on **10 randomly sampled images from the test dataset**, showing the actual label vs. the predicted label along with the confidence score for each.

</div>

> The model correctly predicts most samples with high confidence — including harder cases across different MRI orientations (sagittal, axial, coronal) and even a non-MRI CT scan.

## 📦 Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sriharshith-2006/Brain-Tumor-Classification.git
```

**2. Move into the project folder**

```bash
cd Brain-Tumor-Classification
```

**3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the application**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> The trained model will be downloaded automatically on first run.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The application is deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud**.

Since GitHub enforces a 100 MB file size limit, the trained model (`best_model.pth`) is **not stored in the repository**. Instead, the app automatically downloads it from **Google Drive** via `gdown` when it starts up.
